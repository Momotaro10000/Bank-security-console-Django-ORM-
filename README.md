# Bank security console


This is an internal repository for 'The Siyaniye' bank employees. You won't be able to run this 
repository if you accidentally get into it because you don't have an access to the database, 
however, you can use coding templates freely or look up how database requests are implemented.

Bank security console is a website which can be connected to the visits and our staff passcards 
remote database.
